|_&bull; Scientific Attitudes_|
|---|
|Science had its beginning when man started asking questions about his environment. He wondered where the sun went at night and why the sky was blue. He questioned why the wind blew and the leaves fell. He sought answers to these and other questions. Not all his answers were correct, but at least he did want to know.|
|**Curiosity and Imagination**|
|Science began to develop rapidly when man laid aside his wrong beliefs and began to seek true explanations. Young children are curious about how things work. The child wants to take apart a watch to see what makes it work.|
|Benjamin Franklin wondered about lightning. He combined his curiosity with imagination and carried out his well-known experiment to show that lightning and an electric spark are the same thing. Curiousity and imagination are important qualities which help stimulate the discovery of new facts and advance science.|
|**Belief in Cause and Effect**|
|Scientifically minded people believe in a "cause-and-effect" relationship. They feel there is a perfectly natural explanation for everything. For example, there is a good reason why soe leaves trun red and others yellow in the fall. Changes such as these, which are easily observed, are called phenomena. Some common phenomena, however, are not completely understood. Still others cannot be explained at all at this time. In cases where the explanation is unknown the scientific point of view is that there is a reason if it can only be discovered.|
|**Being Open-Minded**|
|Open-mindedness is also extremely important to a scientific attitude. This means the ability to face the facts as they are regardless of what one has previously thought. It includes an ability to accept new and sometimes even disagreeable ideas. The worker in science must face facts whether they are pleasant or unpleasant. He must expect many failures and be willing to try again. Thomas Edison failed thousands of times before he succeeded in producing the first electric lamp.|
|The solutions to real problems cannot be seen in advance. Scientists must be able to change their thinking and to adapt their theories to new facts as they are discovered. The mind cannot be made up once and for all. New knowledge may make a change in thinking necessary. This is another way of saying that man's understanding is always less than perfect. What is  accepted as true often is relatively, and not absolutely, true. A scientific truth offers an explanation that is acceptable only in the light of what is known at a particular time.|
|**Respect for the Views of Others**|
|Another part of a scientific attitude is respect for the views of others. This is easy when these views are like one's own. The difficulty comes up when their ideas are different. Views which are entirely new or foreign may also be hard to accept.|
|New ideas are frequently very slow to be accepted. Scientists such as Galileo, Louis Pasteur, and Edward Jenner were laughed at because they held theories that were not accepted. Respect for new ideas is important for continued progress in all fields of knowledge.|
|**Opinions Based on Evidence**|
|Sometimes evidence is not complete. It may take time for new facts to become available. When they are available, a person may have to change his mind. New findings may also require a "wait-and-see" attitude. For example, there is an experiment on the sprouting of seeds which has been running for more than 50 years. The purpose is to determine how long a time seeds can be buried in the ground and still grow when proper conditions for growth exist.|

|_&bull; Solving Problems Scientifically_|
|---|
|There are scientific ways in which man solves problems. Once his curiosity has been around, he uses certain methods and procedures to obtain new knowledge and greater understanding. Although the methods are not always the same, there are usually certain elements in the procedures that are similar.|
|**Recognizing the Problem**|
|Problems must first of all be recognized. The right answers can be obtained only if the right questions are asked. A thoroughly understand problem is well started toward solution. Problems arise in a variety of ways. Sometimes they grow out of a chance observation. They may result from reading, fromm laboratory experiments, or simply from thinking. They also may result from new developments or from new or different human needs. Today, for example, problems are arising from new discoveries in the field of nuclear physics, biological engineering and microelectronics. The development of industry has also brought about large numbers of problems which have to be solved.|
|**Collecting Information**|
|Next, the scientist tries to learn as much as possible about it. Often this means going to the library and studying books which contain accounts of man's experience and knowledge of the problem. This is called searching the literature.|
|The scientist may find that others have already solved all or a part of the problem. Occasionally he finds answers to closely related questions, which give clues for solving the new one. In his search the scientist accumulates much background information. With these new ideas and facts he builds a firm foundation for solving the problem.|
|**Organizing the Information**|
|After the scientist has finished this part of his work he will probably take the many facts which he has collected and organize them into some kind of system. This may be a logical classification or it may be a mathematical analysis. Usually the analysis will show unanswered questions. Sometimes it will suggest areas that are in need of further study. Perhaps one of most important results of such an analysis is that it indicates certain truths, which generally are called inferences.|
|**Making a Hypothesis**|
|In making an inference the scientist has built up a hypothesis. A hypothesis is only a "best" guess. It must next be tested.|
|If it is correct, then certain things should follow. This means if a particular experiment is carried out, certain observations ought to be possible or it should be possible to  make certain predictions.|
|Should the observations or predictions turn out to be as expected, the scientist has added confidence in the probable truth of his hypothesis. If, however, observations cannot be made or the predictions are unreliable, the the hypothesis will probably be given up or at least modified.|
|**The Experiment**|
|The hypothesis must check with the facts. Scientific facts are usually established by work in the laboratory. Experiments have to be made under carefully controlled conditions. Thorough and accurate records must be kept.|
|In making certain kinds of experiments in science variables are used. A variable is something which has different values under different conditions. In one type of laboratory test all the variables but one are controlled. This method of testing is called contolled experimentation.|

# Grammar

## 一.用法

是另一种非谓语动词,形式与现在分词相同

### 1. 主语

```
Reading alound is very important in learning a foreign language.

某些结构中,可用引导词it作形式主语放在句首,将实际主语(动名词)放到句尾.

```

### 2. 表语

动名词和不定式都可以作主语或表语. 一般在表示比较抽象的一般行为时多用动名词;在表示具体某次动作或将来发生的动作时,多用不定式.

```

```

### 3. 宾语

以下及物动词及短语动词常用动名词作宾语: avoid, finish, suggest, stop, mind, enjoy, require, postpone, delay, practise, excuse, risk, consider, miss, imagine, deny, escape, put off, give up, keep on, can't help(禁不住)

在like, hate, prefer 后, 如果表示一般倾向, 多用动名词作宾语, 如指特定或具体某次行动, 则用不定式更多.

```

### 4. 介词宾语

动名词也作介词的宾语, 并和介词一起构成介词短语, 在句中作定语/状语/表语.

### 5. 定语

单个动名词也可作定语, 放在被修饰的名词之前. 动名词作定语和现在分词作定语有所不同: 动名词和它所修饰的名词在逻辑上没有主谓关系, 前者不是后者发出的动作. 动名词表示的多是被修饰的名词的功能/用途.

## 二. 时态与语态
### 1. 一般式

```

```

### 2. 完成式

```

可以用物主代词或名词的所有格来修饰,表示动名词逻辑上的主语.

```

```

但在非正式英语中, 尤其是当动名词在句中作宾语时, 更常见的是用人称代词和普通格的名词修饰动名词.

```
Do you mind me making a suggestion?

I'm pleased with John paying his income tax in time.
```
