| Recently we were told by a student that setting aside time for improving his physical fitness would be a total misuse of his working hours. He assured us that he would be no better served by a fitness program than by learning to play bridge. College and his preparation for a career were his only priorities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| This student has seen being physically fit as an end rather than the means we know it to be. His opinion `意见` is one of the many feelings, pro or con, that people hold about their personal involvement in a physical fitness program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Many people, including college students of all ages, speed little time in pursuit of physical fitness. Certainly some of these individuals may have physical limitations that make activity extremely `非常` difficult, and others are engaged in time-consuming activities that until finished do not permit opportunities `机会` for recreation. However, what about the majority who could do much more but do so little? Does one of the following statements sound like you?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Unlike these people who have made no commitment to fitness, you may have made a commitment to a physical fitness program that might be rather narrow in scope. If one of the following comments fit you, perhaps you are failing to see the broader values of maintaining a high level of physical fitness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| If you see your own attitude represented by one of these comments, might you be shortsighted in you reason for valuing fitness? We would suggest that you reexamine your approach to fitness and its ability to positively influence other aspects of you life. Ask yourself, "What could I achieve if I were really in top physical condition?" Because fitness levels are easily observed and can be measured, you can quickly start to see the emerging person you are capable of becoming. Almost daily you can see progress and accomplishment. Keep in mind, however, that all people are different and some may progress faster than others. In the final analysis, we think that althought fitness will not grarantee `保证` that you will live longer, it can help you enjoy the years you do live. |

| One person chooses a bright red car, but another prefers a dark green. One family paints the living room a sunny yellow, but another family uses pure white. One child wants a bright orange ball, but another wants a light blue one.

| In general, people talk about two groups of colors: warm colors and cool colors. Researchers think that there are also two groups of people: people who prefer warm colors and people who prefer cool colors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Red may be exciting, but one researcher says that time seems to pass more slowly in a room with warm colors than in a room with cool colors. He suggests that a warm color, such as red or orange, is a good color for a living room or restaurant. `餐馆` People who are relaxing or eating do not want time to pass quickly. Cool colors are better for offices or factories if the people who are working there want time to pass quickly.                                                                                         |
| Researchers do not know why people think some colors are warm and other colors are cool. However, almost everyone agress that read, orange, and yellow are warm and that green, blue, and violet are cool.

Because the sun is higher during summer, the hot summer sunlight appears yellow.                                                         |

| Businessmen know that people choose products by color. Businessmen want to manufacture`制造` products which are the colors people will buy. For example, an automobile manufacturer needs to know how many cars to paint red, how many green, and how many black. Good businessmen know that young people prefer different colors than old people do and men prefer different colors than women do.                                                                                                                                   |
| Young children react to the color of an object before they react to its shape. They prefer the warm colors -- red, yellow, and orange. When people grow older, they begin to react more to the shape of an object than to its color. The favorite color of adults of all countries is blue. Their second favorite color is red, and their third is green.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| On the whole, women prefer brighter colors than men do. Almost everyone likes red, but women like yellow and green more than men do. Pink is usually considered a feminine color. Blue is usually considered a masculine color. As a result, people dress baby girls in pink and baby boys in blue. However, it is dangerous to generalize because taste changes. For example, years ago businessmen wore only white shirts; today they wear many different colors, including pink.                                                 |
| If two objects are the same except for color, they will look differnt. Color can make an object look nearer or farther, larger or smaller. A red object always looks nearer than a blue objects. For example, red letters on a blue sign look as though they are in front of the sign. Bright objects look larger than dark objects. However, they are actually the same size. Large or fat people who want to look smaller or slimmer wear dark clothes. When they wear dark clothes, they look smaller and slimmer than they are. |
| In conclussion`总之`, color is very important to people. Warm and cool colors affect how people feel. People choose products by color. Moreover, color affects how an object looks. It is even possible that your favorite color tells a lot about you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
