| Rainforests are being cut and burned from Brazil to Indonesia at such a rate that they could well disappear from the earth's surface before the year 2050. They are being cleared for valuable timber and other resources to speed up the economic growth of the nations in which they are located. The most recent figures show that the area of rainforest destroyed last year alone was bigger than the size of Great Britain and Ireland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| If the present rate of deforestation is allowed to continue, the consequences for the earth will be great. We shall see a massive upsetting of ecosystems, very large increases in soil erosion, increase in flooding and in drought, changes in rainfall pattern and regional, quite possibly global, changes in rainfall patterns and regional, quite possibly global, changes in climate. We shall also probably lose many rare plant and animal species.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| According to many scientists, the burning of rainforests is also directly contributing to the so-called greenhouse effect. This effect, they say, is raising coverage temperatures and sea levels as the polar ice caps recede.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| The rainforest is essential in other areas also. It is a medicine chest of unlimited potential. The US National Cancer Institute has identified 2,000 rainforest plants which could be beneficial in fighting cancer. In today's pharmaceutical market, 15 of the 125 drugs derived from plants were discovered in the rainforest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Plants species are not the only forms of life threatened with extinction in the rainforest. Rare birds and animals that cannot be found anywhere else in the world have been disappearing at the rate of one a year since the turn of the century.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| In the face of all these facts, it seems senseless for couintries to continue destroying their rainforests are located are all quite poor and overpopulated. One of them, Brazil, has a population of 140 million, about half of whom are living in absoulte poverty. The governments in these countries are usually also to stop large companies and powerful individuals from destroying the rainforests. They have no money, so when the poor whom they cannot feed find work cutting down trees or burning forestland, the governments often have no choice but to turn a build eye. Moreover, for many of these countries, the valuable timber and other resources found in the rainforests are also a very important source of foreign exchange, which they badly need to pay off their foreign debts and purchase foreign equipment and other goods. |
| The only solution to the problem, then, seems to be for the richer countries of the world to help the countries where the rainforest are located. One way they could help would be by cancelling the international debts that countries like Brazil owe, while also working together with these countries to solve their other economic porblems. At the same time, they could support programmes to teach the local people to regard the rainforests as gardens to be harvested, and not merely as places where the only way for them to make a living is by senselessly cutting down trees and buring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Such programmes could teach the local people how to select trees worth exporting and to cut only those trees down while leaving the rest, so that the basic make-up of the environment needed for the survival of the many rare species of animals and plants, as well as of the Indian tribes that live in the rainforest, could be preserved. The local people could also be taught to earn more money by cutting the selected trees and making them into furniture on the spot. In addition, they could learn how to harvest other valuable natural materials that are now being wasted, and sell them overseas to earn foreign exchange for their countries.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Last but not least, people in the richer countries of the world could also help save the rianforests by using wood-derived products such as paper more carefully and by recycling used paper products to help reduce the demand for newly cut wood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Tundra is the name given to the low, marshy plains of Europe, Siberia, and North America that border on the Arctic Ocean. In Alaska, the vast, cold region known as the "Northern Slope" is part of the tundra. Nature sets harsh terms for surrival in this land. Only those plants and animals that are adapted to the hostile environment can survive in it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Long periods of darkness and bitter cold are the major threats to life on the tundra. At the Arctic Circle, the sun cannot be seen above the horizon in December. North of the Circle, the darkness lasts even longer. Over the northern reaches of the tundra, no sunlight can be seen at all for several months of the year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| The darkness is balanced, to some degree, by continus daylight during the summer months. But even in the warmest month, the temperature only averages about 50 degrees F (10 degrees C). During the dark winter months the average temperature falls to -- 16 degress F (- 27 degrees C), and sometimes to -40 degrees (C and F) and below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Because of the intense cold, the subsoil of the turndra remains permanently frozen to a great depth. During the brief summer, a few (about a meter) of soil thaw at the surface. It is this layer of active soil that supports all living things on the tundra.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| For nine months of the year, the tundra is a dark, seemingly lifeless wild land. Then in June, as if by magic, a never-setting summer sun gives birth to hundreds of species of arctic`极地` plants to cover the ground.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| A plant that grows more than three feet (about a meter) is unusual on the tundra. There are no tall trees. The frozen subsoil prevents roots from growing deep enough to support them. By the end of August the breath of winter returns, and by mid-September the tundra is white again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Tha animal life on the tundra is unusually rich for an environment that seems so harsh. Herds of arctic deer move from place to place in search of food. Band of wolves follow them and hunt for the weak or sick ones.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Few birds actually live on the tundra. However, a variety of birds migrate to nest and feed during the summer. The wet`潮湿的`, marshy`沼泽的,湿地的` land produces a large number of insects`昆虫` that provide food for the smaller birds that, in turn, provide food for the arctic fox and the wolf.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| The balance of nature is so delicate on the tundra that even minor disturbances may produce major changes in the environment. Any increase or decrease in the population of one species may affect all other species on the tundra. FOr example, if the number of wolves and foxes decrease, the food chain is upset. Without wolves, the number of grazing animals --  like the deer -- would increase. This increase would result in a food shortage, which would cause death to many smaller animals. A decrease in the number of these smaller animals would in turn decrease the food supply for the arctic fox and the wolf. In this way, the entire food chain might be-affected by a change in the number of a single species. |
| Until recently, the changing seasons on the tundra were seem only by a few Eskimo hunters and explorers. What would draw men and women to live in such a hostile land? The answer is oil.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| In 1968, oil was discovered beneath the frozen soil on Alaska's Northem Slope. Now an 800-mile (about 1300 kilometers) pipeline has been built from Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic Ocean to Valdes, a port on the south coast of Alaska. The pipeline carries the oil from the Northern Slope, across the tundra, to the port. From there, it is shipped to the rest of the United States.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Thousands of men and women were needed to build and maintain the pipeline. For the first time, large numbers of people were brought into contact with the tundra. Their presence and the presence of the pipeline they built represented a major change in the environment. How will the life cycles of the tundra be affected?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| The survival of the United States depends on the ability to find new sources of energy. Oil from beneath the tundra is very important to the nations's development. But the survival of the tundra depends on how careful people maintain the delicate balance of nature in this environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
