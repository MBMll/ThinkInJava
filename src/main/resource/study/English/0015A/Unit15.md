|_&bull; How TV Violence Affects Kids_|
|---|
|For more than a quarter of a century, evidence has been increasing that children's exposure to violence on television has long-lasting effects on their behavior. Ebtween 1982 and 1986, the amount of television timem allocated each week to violent programs increased significantly. And the number of violent acts on television in the past years ahs increased from about 19 to 27 per hour. Given the amount of time that children watch television, it has become one of the most powerful models they want to follow.|
|The Position Statement on Media Violence in Children's live, recently adopted by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, points out that preschool children are particularly easily affected by the media because they are not yet fully able to distinguish fantasy from reality and their understanding of the underlying motives for behavior and the subtleties of moral conflicts is not get well developed. For example, the rapid recoveries of people on TV from violent attacks give children an unrealistic picture of the jnjuries that have been suffered.|
|**Effects on Play**|
|Children naturally often want the toys shown on and advertised during these programs. And with these toys, their play tends to be more imitative than imaginative. Children simply imitate the imaginative and the expressive functions of play. The narrow range of most violence-related toys advertised on television jeopardizes the role of play in helping children make better sense of their own feeling and interpret their world. Some research even suggests that children apply the behaviors observed on TV programs to their real-life situations.|
|**Parents Can Help**|
|It is a good idea for parents to monitor the amount as well as kind of television their preschool child watches. If you child appears to be crazy about war play and weapons, it would be a good idea to control his viewing. Controlling viewing is easier to do during the preschool years than during the chool years, so you should imitiate a pattern of restricted television watching now.|
|Help your child to interpret what she sees -- to think of explanations for the events depicted and to imagine how the show is put together. Make simple critiques of a show without implying that her fascination with drama and the weapons makes her guilty by association.|
|Ask the teachers of your child's preschool about their policy on war play and toy weapons. Many preschool teachers do not like to have commercially amde toy weapons brought into the classroom and welcome hearing you concerns about this matter. Look for other parents who share your views. Work together to control the amount of violent programs watched and the numbmer of violent toys found in the home. Try to arrange play dates for the children as an alternative to TV viewing. Or look for videos of healthy, nonviolent programs for children, and encourage their use as an attractive alterantive to violent television programs. |

|_&bull; Why Don't Girls Think Like Boys?
|---|
|Do you believe that only boys do well in science? Does it seem to you that girls have better vocabularies than boys? In your opinion, are boys better at build things? If you answer to each of those questions is "Yes," you are right, according to an article in Current Science. There are exceptions, but here are the facts.|
|On the average, males score higher on test that measure mathematical reasoning, mechanical ability, and problem-solving skills. Females show superior ability in test measuring vocabulary spelling, and memory. Put these difference will probably not always exist. In the future, a person's abilities may not be determined by sex. As one scientist say, "Nothing is impossible for a person to be or do."|
|In several recent studies, young babies have been observed and tested to discover how different abilities are developed. A scientific team headed by Jerome Kagan, a psychologist at Harvard University, is studying the thinking ability of children 11 1/2 months old. The test is a simple one. The baby, while seated on its mother's lap watches a "show" on a small theater stage.|
|In act 1 of the show, an orange-colored block is lifted from a blue box and moved slowly across the stage. Then it is returned to the box. This is repeated six times. Act 2 is similar, except that the orange block is smaller. Baby boys do not seem to notice the difference in the size of block, but girls immediately become excited and begin to make noises that sound like language. They seem to be trying to talk.|
|It is known that bones, muscles, and nerves develop faster in baby girls. Usually, too, baby girls talk at an earlier age than boys do. Scentists think these is a physical reason for this. They believe that merves in the left side of the brain develop faster in girls than in boys. And it is this side of the brain that strongly influences an individual's ability to use words, to spell, and to remember things.|
|By the time they start to school, therefore, little girls have an advantage that boys do not have. Girls are physically more ready to remember facts, to speel, and to read. These, of course, are skill that are iiportant in elementary school.|
|But what have the boys been doing in the years before starting school? They have been developing something called aggression. An aggressive person has courage and energy. He feels strong and independent. He is often the first one to start a fight.|
|What produces aggression in little boys? It has long been assumed that aggression is caused by male hormones. Scientists today believe that male hormones are only part of the explanation, however. They are aggressiveness in boys is also caused by mothers.|
|A team of psychologist discovered this by placing mothers and their one-year-old babies in a room filled with toys. The room head a wall through which the scientists could observe what happened without being seen. They took notes on everything the mothers and babies did.|
|"Baby leans against mother. Looks up at her. She speaks to hime. She turn him around. He walks away, picks up toy cat. Goes to mother, drops cat, and leans against her. Looks up at her. She turns him around."|
|From such observations and from conversations with mothers, the scientist learned something about the treatment of baby boys and baby girls. While the mother keeps her daughter close to her, she trains her son to move away from her, to develop independence.|
|Consequently, it is easy to understand why little girls often perform school tasks better than boys, especially of the task requires sitting still, obeying commands, and accepting the teacher's ideas. A girl may pass easiy through the first few grades. While boys of her age bring home low markes, the girl may easily get good grades. Girls seem to have "better brains" in school. Why, then, do so few girls become great scientists, the answer is aggression. Because boys are aggressvie, they refuse to accept other people's solution; they insiste upon solving problems for themselves. Thus, while little girls are getting high marks in school for remembering what the teacher has told them, little boys are learing to think in more independent ways.|
|In the adult world, the aggressive person is usually the one who gets the big salary, the great responsibility, the powerful job. And since males are trained at an early age to be aggressvie, males are more often chosen for key positions.|
|Many people believe this situation is wrong. They think women could be successful in scence and indutry if they were trained to be independent and problem-solving, as boys are.|
