| In every cultivated language there are two great classes of words which, taken together, make up the whole vocabulary. First, there are those words with which we become familiar in ordinary conversation, which we learn, that is to say, from the members of our own family and from our friends, and which we should know and use even if we could not read or write. They concern the common things of life, and are the stock in trade of all who speak the language. Such words may be called "popular," since they belong to the people at large and are not the possession of a limited class only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| On the other hand, our language includes a large number of words which are relatively seldom used in ordinary conversation. Their meanings are known to every educated person, but there is little occasion to use them at home. Our first acquaintance with them comes not from our mother's lips or from the talk of our classmates, but from books that we read, lectures that we hear, or the more formal conversation of highly educated speakers who are discussing some particular topic in an elevated style. Such words are called "learned", and the difference between them and "popular" words is of great importance to a right understanding of language.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| The difference between popular and learned words may be easily seen in a few examples. We may describe a gril as "lively" or as "vivacious." In the first case, we are using a native English word formed from the familiar noun life. In the latter, we are using a Latin derivative which has exactly the same meaning. Yet the atmosphere of the two words is quite different. No one ever got the adjective lively out fo a book. It is a part of everybody's vocabulary. We cannot remember a time when did not know it, and we feel sure that we learned it long before we were able to read. On the other hand, we must have passed several years of our lives before learning the word vivacious. We may even remember the first time that we saw it in print or heard it from some grown-up friend. Both lively and vivacious are good English words, but lively is popular and vivacious is learned.                                                                                                                             |
| The terms "popular" and "learned," as applied to words, are not absolute definitions. No two persons have the same stock of words and the same words may be "popular" in one man's vocabulary and "learned" in another's. There are also different grades of "poplularity." Still, the classification into "learned" and "popular" is convenient and sound. Different opinions may come up as to the classification of any particular word, but there can be no differece of opinion about the general principle. We must be careful, however, to avoid misconception. When we call a word "popular," we do not mean that it is a favorite word, but simply that it belongs to the people as a whole -- that is, it is everybody's word, not the possession of a limited number. When we call a word "learned" we do not mean that it is used by learned persons alone, but simply that its presence in the English vocabulary is due to books and the cultivation of literature rather than to the actual needs of ordinary conversation. |

| When students in a college class were asked what should be done when they came across a new word in their reading, 84 percent said, "Look it up in the dictionary." If you do, however, you interrupt the very mental processes needed to make your efforts most productive.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| But there's another reason. Suppose someone asks you what the word "fast" means. You answer, "swift." But does it mean that in such contexts as "fast color," "fast woman," or "fast friend"? And if a horse is fast, is it securely tied or running at top spped? It could be either. It all depends. On the dictionary? No, on context -- on how the word is actually used. After all there are over twenty different meanings for "fast" in the dictionary. But the dictionary doesn't tell you which for "fast" in the dictionary. But the dictionary doesn't tell you which meaning is intended. That's why it makes such good tell you which meaning is intended. That's why it makes such good sense to begin with context. |

| Now for the next step. Often new words contain one or more parts, which, if recognized, provide specific help with meaning Suppose you read that someone "had a preference for reading travel books." The context certainly isn't too helpful. But do you see a prefix, suffix, or root that you know? Well, there's the familiar prefix pre-, meaning "before." Look back at the context and try inserting "before." Reading travel books apparently comes "before" other kinds of reading. Yes, a preference is something put "before" some thing else.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Your second step, then, is to look for familiar word parts. If they do not give you exact meaning, they should at least bring you much closer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Now you can see why you should consult the dictionary last, not first. You're looked carefully at context. You're looked for familiar word parts. Now you play Sherlock Holmes -- an exciting role. You guess. What exactly does that strange word mean? Only when you go through the mental exercises to come up with a tentative definition should you open the dictionary to see if you're right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| After all, those first two steps or approaches spark a stronger than usual interest in that dictionary definition. You're now personally involved. Did you find out the word and meaning. It also encourages your development of the habits needed to speed your progress. And when you see in black and white the definition you had expected, what a feeling of success is yours. In that way, the CPD Formula provides you with maximum effectiveness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

# Grammar
## 分词

是一种非谓语动词. (现在分词/过去分词) 带状语或宾语的分词称为分词短语

### 用法

分词作用相当于形容词和副词,在句中担当定语,表语,状语,宾(主)语补足语.

#### 1. 定语

修饰名词或代词. 单个分词通常放在被修饰名词之前. 分词短语放在被修饰的名词之后. 有时单个的过去分词放在被修饰的名词之后.

He often helps his working wife at home.

The members of an extended family are called relatives.

Who is the lady standing by the door?

We can see only the part of the moon lighted by sunlight.

They decided to change the material used.

#### 2. 状语

表示时间,原因,方式,结果,条件,让步,伴随 等. 通常放在句首或句尾, 有时也可以插在句子的主谓语之间. 分词作状语时,它逻辑上的主语应与句子的主语一致.
```
Relying on our own efforts, we overcame all the difficulties.

Hearing the news, they all jumped with joy.

The teacher walked about the classroom, using his hands to help him in his explanation.

The child fell, striking his head against the door and cutting it.

The students went out of the school, laughing and talking.

Given better attention, the trees could grow better.

This method, tried in our village, resulted in a marked rise in total production.
```

为了表示明确的时间或条件,有时可以在分词前加when,while,if等连词.

```
When leaving the airport, she waved again and again to us.

Be careful when crossing the street.

While waiting for the train, I had a long talk with Jane.

If translated word by word, the setence will be meaningless.
```

分词有时也可以有自己独立的逻辑上的主语(即与句子的主语不一致), 称为独立结构(absolute construction), 在很多情况下表示时间/原因/条件或伴随的动作或情况.

```
The holidays being over, they began to get down to do their work again.

So many people being absent, we decide to put the meeting off.

Weather permitting, the football match will be played on Wednesday.

We went far into the forest, her father acting as guide.

Emile stood there, his eyes never leaving "the black hat."
```

有时这样的独立结构还可以用介词with引导.

```
He stood there wit his hands crossed before him.

With tears rolling down her cheeks, she carefully covered her mother's body with sand.
```

#### 3. 表语

分词常在系词后作表语.

```
The news is exciting.

Don't get excited, please.

She looked disappointed.

The story of his life sounds interesting.

The door remained locked.
```

#### 4. 宾/主语补足语

分词可以在 see, hear, notice, watch, keep, find, get, have, feel 等动词后与一个名词或代词构成复合宾语, 担当宾语补足语

```
Don't you see him coming towards us? 

She suddenly heard someone knocking at the door.

He sat at his deak and watched others doing the work for him .

When I entered the room, I found him reading something aloud.

He was glad to see his son well taken care of in the day-care center.

You should keep her informed of what is going on here.

He was surprised to find his room thoroughly cleaned and everything arranged in good order.
```

当谓语动词变为被动语态时, 原主动语态句中的宾语变为主语, 宾补变主补.

```
The hall was found thoroughly cleaned and everthing arranged in good order.

The children were heard singing the song.

The news was made known at last.

We were kept waiting for more than three hours.
```

在 see, hear, feel, watch, notice 等动词后即可用现在分词也可以用不带 to 的不定式作宾语补足语. 两者在意义上有时有差别. 现在分词强调动作正在进行和发展之中, 而不定式表示动作的全过程已经结束.

```
She saw the man getting on the truck.

She saw the man get on the struck and drive off.

-- Do you hear someone knocking at the door?

-- Yes, I heard him knock three times.
```

### 分词的时态和语态

|     | 主动形式           | 被动形式                |
| --- | ---            | ---                 |
| 一般式 | writing        | being writing       |
| 完成式 | having written | having been written |

#### 1. 完成式

现在分词的完成时主要用在状语,表示这个动作在谓语动作之前发生.

```
Having done his homework, hte boy began to watch TV.

Having watered the vegetables, the farmer took a short rest.

Not having done it right, he tired again.
```

#### 2. 被动式

现在分词的被动式不仅表示动作被动,而且表示这个动作正在发生,或者这个动作与谓语动词的动作同时发生.

现在分词的被动式主要用作 : 定语, 状语, 宾语补足语.

```
The bridge being built there will be one of the longest in China.

This is one of the experiments being carried on in laboratory. 

Being surrounded, the enemy were forced to put down their guns.

He found teh topic being discussed everywhere.
```

#### 3. 完成被动式

现在分词的完成被动式不仅表示被动的动作,而且表示这个动作在谓语动词所表示的动作之前发生.

```
Having been given such a good chance, how could she give it up?

Having been told that some guests were coming, she stopped all morning in that super market.
```
