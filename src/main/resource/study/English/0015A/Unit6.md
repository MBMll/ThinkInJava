|Diamonds are rare,beautiful, and also quite useful. They are the hardest substance found in nature. That means a diamonds can cut any other surface. And only another diamond can make a slight cut in a diamond.|
|Diamonds are made from carbon. Carbon is found in all living things, both plant and animal. Much of the carbon in the earth comes from things that once lived.|
|Scientists know that the combination of extreme heat and pressure changes carbon into diamonds. Such heat and pressure exist only in the hot, liquid mass of molten rock deep inside the earth. It is thought that millions of years ago this liquid mass pushed upward through cracks in the earth's crust. As the liquid cooled, the carbon changed into diamond crystals.|
