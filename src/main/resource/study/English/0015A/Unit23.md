| If anyone asked you what were the main means of communication between people, what would you say? That isn't a catch question. The answer is simple and obvious. It would almost certainly refer to means of conmmunication that involve the use of words. Speakers and listeners -- oral communication which we all use most of the time, usually without knowing it. This is sometimes called body language. Its more technical name is non-verbal communication. Non-verbal, became it does not involve the use of words. NVC for short.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| When someone is saying something with which he agrees, the average European will smile and nod approval. On the other hand, if you disagree with what they are saying, you may frown`皱眉` and shake your head. In this way you signal your reactions, and communicate them to the speaker without saying a word. I refered a moment ago to "the average European", because body language is very much tied to culture, and in order not to misunderstand,  or not to be misunderstood, you must realize this. A smiling Chinese, for instance, may not be approving but somewhat embarrassed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Ouite a lot of work is now being done on the subject of NVC, which is obviously important, for instance, to managers, who have to deal every day with their staff, and have to understand what other people are feeling if they are to create good working conditions. Body language, or NVC signals, are sometimes categorised into five kinds: 1. body and facial gestures; 2. eye contact; 3. body contact or "proximity"; 4. clothing and physical appearance; and 5. the quality of speech. I expect you understood all those, except perhaps "proximity". This simply means "closeness". In some cultures -- and I am sure this is a cultural feature and not an individual on -- it is quite normal for people to stand close together, or to more or less thrust their face into yours when they are talking to you. In other cultures, this is disliked; Americans, for instance, talk about invasion of their space. |
| Some signals are probably common to all of us. If a public speaker ( like a professor, for example) is all the time fidding with a pencil, or with his glasses, while he is talking to you, he is telling you quite clearly that he is nervous. A person who holds a hand over his mouth when he is talking is signalling that he is lacking in confidence. If you start wriggling in your chairs, looking secretly at your watches or yawing behind you hands. I shall soon get the message that I'm boring you. And so on. I'm sure you could make a whole list of such signals -- and it might be fun if you did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| All the signals I have mentioned so far can be controlled. If you are aware that you are doing these things, you can stop. You can even learn to give false signals. Most public speakers are in fact nervous, but a good speaker learns to hide this by giving off signals of confidence`信任`. Other kinds of NVC are not so easy to control. Eye contact, for instance. Unless you are confessing intense love. you hardly ever look into someone else's eyes for very long. If you try it, you'll find they will soon look away, probably in embarrassment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| I've already mentioned proximity, so just a brief word now about our last two categories, which concern the way people dress and the way they speak. These are both pretty obvious signals. People may dress casually and speak casually`随意地`, which sginals that they are relaxed. Or they can dress formally and speak formally, showing their tenseness. In fact, non-verbal communication can, as the saying goes, speak volumnes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Have you ever wondered why you sometimes take an almost immediate liking to a person you have just met? Or worried about why someone you were talking to suddenly became cool and distant? The chances are that it wasn't anything that was said but something that happened: a gesture, a movement, a smile. Social Scientists are now devoting considerable attention to "non-verbal communication", what happens when people get together, apart from their actural conversation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

He feels that gestures, movements and physical closeness have meaning which the words that the people are using do not carry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| The closeness of two people when talking, movement towards and away from each other, and the amount of eye contact all reveal something about the nature of the relationship between the two individuals. We tend to be only subconsiously aware, if at all, of the various patterns and rituals of social behavior. We expect other people ot act according to the same "rules" that we do, so much so that the manners and behavior of persons from another culture can be extremely confusing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| For example, North Americans tend to expect more physical distance between two speakers than do Latin Americans. Consequently`因此`, when the Latin American seems to be learning too close, the North American complains of "invasion of his space". The Latin American, on the other hand, often considers the North American to be "cold" or "distant" because he keeps a greater distance between himself and the person he is speaking to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Eye contact is one way of measuring the degree of closeness of relationship between two speakers, although there are cultural variations in the meaning of eye contact. In the Middle East, for example, it is considered extremely provocative for a woman to let a man catch her eye, let alone return his gaze. Social psychologist Michael Argyle observes that there is more eye contact between people who like each other than those who are indifferent or hostile towards each other. And the longer the length of the gaze, the more likely it is that the listener is more interested in the person who is speaking, than the actual topic of conversation. Frequently looking down can indicate submissiveness or embarrassment. Looking away down can indicate submissiveness or embarrassment. Looking away repeatedly may express boredom or dislike. Women tend`倾向于` to engage`吸引` in more eye contact than men, especially when talking to other women. |
| But too steady eye contact can make one feel uneasy at times. Most people become uncomfortable under the intense gaze`凝视` of a stare. One scientist suggests that perhaps one reason that man becomes tense under the force of a stare is in his biological ancestors: in apes, a stare signifies aggressiveness and hostility. The person who insistently fixes his eyes on our face is often more successful in arousing our dislike than impressing us with his directness and sincerity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Similarly, the smile cannot always be interpreted as a sign of friendliness. The person who smiles almost constantly and with little apparent reason makes us uneasy. Even though he may believe that he is expressing friendliness, he may really seem nervous and tense. In other animals, bared teeth are a warning gesture, a danger sign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Genuine warmth or interest can be revealed in the eyes, suggests Dr. Eckhard Hess of the University of Chicago, who believes that the pupils of the eyes can indicate emotion or interest. The opened pupil tends to be associated with pleasant, satisfying experieness. That special sparkle in the lover's eyes need not be fantasy, for love may make the pupil grow larger. Sometimes when we feel that a person is "warm" or "friendly", it is possbile we are reacting to a form of non-verbal communication -- his opened pupils.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| The next time you are at a party, take note of some of the silent messages being sent around you. Notice which person seem to draw naturally together to speak, which other try to stay further apart or even avoid meeting each other's eyes. You may find that this silent language is much more fascinating than the actual conversation going on around you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
