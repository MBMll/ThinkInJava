|_&bull; Families_|
|---|
|"Family" -- the word has different meaning for different people, and even the dictionary gives us several definitions: "a group of people related by blood or marriage," "two adults and their children," "all those people descended form a common ancestor," "a household," and so on. Some people think of a family as a mother, a father, and their children; others include grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. For some of us, family means the group of relatives living far away from home. For others, having a family simply means having children. Some families have long histories, while others know very little about their ancestors. No matter if it is young or old, large or small, traditional or modern, every family has a sense of what a family is. It is that feeling of belonging, of love and security that comes from living together, helping and sharing.|
|There are basically two types of families: nuclear families and extended faimilies. The nuclear family usually consists of two parents (mother and father) and their children. The mother and father form the nucleus, or center, of the nuclear family. The children stay in the nuclear family until they grow up and marry. Then they form new nuclear families.|
|The extended family is very large. There are often many nuclear families in one extended family. An extended family includes children, parents, grand-parents, uncles, aunts, and cousins. The members of an extended family are related by blood (grandparents, parents, children, brothers, sisters, etc.) or by marriage (husbands, wives, mothers-in-law, etc.) They are all related, so the members of an extended family are called relatives.|
|Traditionally, all the members of an extended family lived in the same area. However, with the change from an agricultural to an industrial society, many nuclear families moved away from the family home in order to find work. In industrial societies today, the members of most nuclear families live together, but most extended families do not live together. Therefore we can say that the nuclear family become more important than the extended family as the society industrializes.|
|In post-industrial societies like the United States, even the nuclear family is changing. The nuclear family is becoming smaller as parents want fewer children, and the number of childless families is increasing. Traditionally, the farther of a nuclear family earned money for the family while the mother cared for the house and the children. Today, more than 50% of the nuclear families in the United States are two-earner families -- both the farther and the mother earn money for the family -- and in a few families the mother earns the money while the farther takes care of the house and the children. Many nuclear families are also "splitting up" -- more and more parents are getting divorced.|
|What will be the result of this "splitting" of the nuclear family? Social scientists now talk of two new family forms: the single parent family and the remarried family. Almost 20% of all Amearican families are single parent families, and in 85% of these families the single parent is the mother. Most single parent find it very difficult to take care of a family alone, so they soon marry again and form remarried families. As social scientists study these two new family forms, they will be able to tell us more about the future of the nuclear family in the post-industrial age.|

|_&bull; The Changing American Family_|
|---|
|The family is important to people all over the world although the structure of the family is quite different from one country to another. In the United States, as in many countries in the world, the family is changing. A generation or two ago, the traditional family, in which the father was boss, was customary. Now, the modern family, in which both the father and the mother are equal partners, is more common. Although there are several similarities between the traditional and the modern family, there are also some very important differences.|
|The traditional family of yesterday and the modern family of today have several similarities. The traditional family was a nuclear family, and the modern family is, too. The role of the father in the traditional family was to provide for his family. Similarly, the father in the modern family is expected to do so, also. The mother in the traditional family took care of the children's physical and emotional needs just as the modern mother does.|
|On the other hand, there are some great differences between the traditional family and the modern family. The first important difference is in the man's role. The traditional husband was the head of the household, because he was the only one who worked outside the home. If the wife worked for pay, then the husband was not considered to be a good provider. In many families today, both huband and wife work for pay. Therefore, they share the role of head of household. In addition, the traditional husband usually made the big decisions about spending money. However, the modern husband shares these decisions with his working wife. Also, the traditional husband did not help his wife with the housework or meal preparation. Dinner was ready when he came home. In contrast, the modern husband helps his working wife at home. He may do some of the household jobs, and it is not unusual for him to cook.|
|The second difference is in the woman's role. In the traditional family, the woman may have worked for pay during her first years of marriage. However, after she became pregnant, she would usually give up her job. Her primary role was to take care of her family and home. In contrast, in many families today, the modern woman work outside the home even after she has children. She's doing two jobs instead of one, so she is busier than the traditional mother was. The traditional wife learned to live within her husband's income. On the other hand, the modern wife does not have to because the family has two incomes.|
|The final difference is in the role of the children. In the traditional family, the children were taken care of by the mother because she did not work outside the home. However, today preschool children may go to a child care center or to a baby-sitter regularly because the mother works. The school-age children of a traditional family were more dependent. Their mother was there to help them to get ready for school and to make their breakfast. In contrast, modern children are more independent. They have to get up early in the morning and get ready for school. Their mother is busy getting ready for work, so they may even have to make their own breakfast.|
|In conclusion, the American family of today is different from the family of fifty years ago. In the modern family, the roles of the father, mother, and children have changed as more and more women work outside the home. The next century may bring more improtant changes to the American family structure. It should be interesting to see.|
