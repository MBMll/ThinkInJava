| Who do you think breaks the law in our society? If you believe that only tough guys commit crimes, you may have to think again. Answer the following questions honestly. Has anyone you know ever driven drunk? Can you think of a friend who has used drugs? Are you aware that your parents may not always tell the truth when they go through customs? Won't some of your friends admit that they have stolen an item from a store? Have any of your friends ever copied a CD onto a tape for someone else?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| In case you did not know, all of these acts are against the law. Now, among the people you know, how many have never broken the law? Does that mean that most members of our society should go to jail? Unlike in the movies, we can't divide the world into bad guys and model citizens. Real life is much more complex. In the same way that disease range from the common cold to fatal[致命的] forms of cancer[癌], crimes vary in degree. For example, smoking in an elevator will inconvenience people, but much less than threatening[威胁] them with a gun.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| In addition to breaking the law themselves, people tolerate various levels of crime. Why are we tolerant of some crimes? It may be that, by seeing others do something, we accept it more easily. We may even start committing that crime ourselves. For instance[例], most people will find it easier to speed on a highway when everybody else is driving over the speed limit. Whne people celebrate a sports championship[冠军称号], if they see someone breaking store windows, they might start breaking windows themselves or even steal[偷] from the store. So the people around us influnce how much lawbreaking we can tolerate[容忍].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| We must also wonder whether seeing violence[暴力] on television or reading about it in the newspapers every day makes us tolerate crime more than we should. We become used to seeing blood on the news on television, or in full color in newspapers and magazines. Because we see the thousands of dead people on TV, maybe we just try to ignore the situation behind the violence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| If so many citizens[公民,市民] tolerate violence and crime, or even commit crimes themselves, it may simply be because of the human mind. Our minds may not care about specific laws. Instead, our minds may have a system of values that usually prevents us from hurting other people to improve our own lives. Yet, when it comes to respecting[尊重] the rights of a mass of not steal a wallet containing $50, they may not mind cheating[骗] on taxes, because cheating on taxes does not hurt any one person. It hurts society, but "society" remains an abstract idea that is not as real as a neighbor or a friend's friend. Perhaps this is why someone who robs a few dollars by force from a corner store will often end up with a longer jail term than a fraud[骗子,诡计] artist who swindless[诈骗] thousands of dollars: threatening the life of an individual is not acceptable in our society. |
| When are look at the questions in the first paragraph and realize that many people have misconceptions about law-breaking, we could think it is surprising that only about 10% of Canadians have a criminal record. How could we improve the level of honesty in our society? Would a larger police force keep everyone honest? Would severe laws help make our society better? Probably not. The police would never be able to keep an eye on everyone, and people would still find ways to bend new laws. Honestly will have to come from social pressure: in the family, at school, on the job, each and every one of us can encourage honesty by showing which behaviors are unacceptable. Teaching respect should become everyone's responsibility.                                                                                                                                            |

| Though marriage is practiced in almost all countries of the world, the customs are quite different from one culture to another. It is interesting for me to compare the customs[风俗] of marriage in the United States with those in my country.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| I've lived in the U.S. for four years now, but I'm still not comfortable with the customs here. In fact, what seems strange to me is that courting or dating is not always for the purpose of finding a hsuband or wife. Some people seem to do it as a hobby.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Here in the United States, I have noticed that courting is began by the young couple[结合,成婚] themselves, and they seem to have a lot of freedom to decide and do what they want. Both young men and women date a number of different people. They do it without the knowledge or help of their parents. In fact, I have known several friends who got marrial without even telling their parents or other family members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| At the actual wedding ceremony, the father of the birde symbolically gives his daughter to the groom. It's only a custom, I think, because the bride and groom already know each other quite well. The bride and groom stand together in front of the religious leader or government offical to be married. The official reads from a short prepared speech adn then asks both the man and woman if they are willing to be married ot the other. If they both say "yes", and nobody attending the wedding stands up to object, they are declared "man and wife". It is interesting that the who families are asked if there are any objections right during the ceremony. Perhaps it is because the family members are not as involved in the wedding preparations as they are in Iran. |
| Marriage is different in a number of ways in my country. In Iran, courting is more serious, and is performed strictly for the purpose of marriage. It is definitely not a part of the fun-filled years of growing up like it is here in America. It is the mother of the young man who initiates the process by visiting the home of a potential bride. She goes to inspect the girl, and discover the position and wealth of the girl's family. If she is pleased, then she will return another day with her son. If her son is also pleased, then the two families get together to talk about the dowry, the wedding ceremony, who they will hire to perform the marriage and other matters.                                                                                          |
| The actual marriage ceremony is quite different, however, from the American wedding ceremonies I have seen. The bride, dressed in white, with a veil[蒙上面纱] over her face, sits in a room alone. She sits on a special piece of silk[丝绸] which is surrounded on two sides by very long pieces of flat bread. Two mullahs stand outside the door to this room reading from the Koran. Twice the bride must remain silent to the questions of the mullahs. The groom's mother then presents a gift of gold to show that her side of the family is serious. The bride then responds to the mullahs in much the same manner as do Americans when they say "I do." The groom is allowed to go into the bride's room while the mullahs take care of the officical marriage papers.             |
| One more difference between the marriage customs of the United States and my country is that the bride does not immediately go to the home of her new husband. For several months, she continues to stay at her own home preparing her dowry and receiving instructing fromher mother on how to be a good wife and mother. After a few months, the groom and his relatives come for the bride and take her to his home along with the dowry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Though I can certainly see the advantages of the freedom that is given to American youths to choose whom they will marry and when, I think I still prefer the customs of my home country. I suppose that's because there is not so much guessing and uncertainty.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
