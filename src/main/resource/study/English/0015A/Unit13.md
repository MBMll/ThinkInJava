| An insurance agent called me this morning. This particular agent wanted to discuss my automobile coverage, but the next agent to call might be interested in my life insurance program, my health insurance, or fre protectioin for my home and  furniture. The American consumer often feels constantly disturbed by insurance agents. Many agents selling many different policies call us by phone and sometimes even come to our doors. These insurance always friendly, well dressed, and eager to be of help.                                                                               |
| Yet few Americans really enjoy visiting with these eager, helpful men and women. We are not happy when they all us; we are an guard when they visit our homes. They are never really our friends; at best, they are a necessary evil.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Three reasons why we can unwilling to discuss insurance can be suggested. First of all, insurance is expensive. A young father who purchases a fairly small life insurance policy agress to pay s sun of $200 every year for 40 years -- a totoal of $8,000. Many college students pay $800 to  $1000 per year for car insurance. In effect they pay as much for the insurance as they do for the car itself. Health insurance that pays for modern medical miracles often costs Americans as much as $2,000 every year. Adequate in surance is expensive; it is a major item for most families. |
| Insurance also reminds us that we live in an unsafe world. We are human and we must face the possiblilites of illness, injury, death, and financiall loss. Our rational minds recognize the many unfortunate events that can occur, but in our hearts we hope that we might be speed. Serious injury or death is not a pleasant subject to discuss or even consider. We are afraid; we would rather talk about football or the weather or what we had for launch.                                                                                                                                |
| Finally, insurance is a diffcult, complex subject. No one understands it completely and only a few insurance professional really feel comfortable in a discussion of automobile, life, and major medical coverage. We feel inadequate and try to hide our ignorance by avoiding discussions of insurance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Yet these three reasons for not discussing insurance provide three excellent reasons why we should learn more about it. Insurance is expensive. In a lifetime, many of us spend our money intelligently, we need inforamtion about the products and services available. We don't depend entirely on the agent when we buy insurance. We need a basic knowledge of insurance converage if we are to be intelligent consumers.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| The intelligent consumer looks problems in the face. Although accident, illness, and death are not pleasant subjects, each of us knows we face these possibilities. It is better that we plan for these situations by finding means to deal with them tahn to just hope that they will somhow go away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Although insurance can be complex, its basic concepts are neither diffcult nor impossible to learn. Quite the opposite. Insurance fundamentals can be understood by those willing to study them. serious study provides knowledge. The study of insurance in an effective, proven method of dealing with the insurance ignorance faced by many American families.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Money is something you're been familiar with throught your life. In fact, you may already consider yourself an expert on the subject. You regularly use money to measure the value of things you own. You also have some of it in your pocket and in bank accounts. It might surprise you to learn that there's a great deal of disagreement among economists about what money is and how to measure it. Money serves a number of functions, and any definition of money must consider all of its functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| The four major functions of money are as a medium of exchange, a standard of value, a standard of deferred payment, and a store of value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| A Medium of Exchange. As a generally accepted medium of exchange, money rules out the need for barter, the direct exchange of one item for another. Barter is a very inconvenient means of trading because it requires the double coincidence of wants. A seller with a good or service to offer must search for a buyer who has exactly what the seller desires. For example, if a barker wants meat, he must search for a person who sells meat and want bread under a barter system. Because money is generally accepted as payment for any purchase, a baker who sell bread for money can use the money to buy meat or anything else he wants.                                                                                          |
| A Standard of Value. Money provides a unit of account that serves as a standard to measure value. The value of an item is a measure of what a person will sacrifice to to obtain it. How much is a two week vacation in Hawaii worth to you? If you'r like most people, you'll probably respond to such a question by valuing the vacation in dollars -- say $2,000 -- rather than in items of other things (like your car). Whether or not you're conscious of it, you're constantly valuing items in dollars. As a standard of value, money dollars the addition of values of many different items as automobiles, repairs, and all other goods and services. The concept of GNP is unlesswithout a standard of value such as the dollar. |
| A Standard of Deferred Payment. Many contracts involve promises to pay sums of money in the future. The unit of account for deferred payment of debts is also money. If you borrow money to buy a car, the loan contract specifies how much you must pay back every month and the number of months required to satisfy your obligation. However, money serves its function as a standard of deferred payment only if its purchasing power remains fairly constant over time. If the price level rises, the future purchasing power of money over time will go down. Similarly, a decrease in the price level will increase the future purchasing power of money.                                                                            |
| A Store of Value. Money can also serve as a store of value that can be quickly converted to goods and services. Money as the actual medium of exchange is completely liquid, meaning it can immediately be converted to goods and services without any inconvenience or cost. Other assets that serve as stores of value must first be sold to be converted into a generally accepted medium of exchange. There are often costs and inconvenience associated with liquidating other assets. Holding money as a store of value thus can reduce the transaction costs involved in everyday business.                                                                                                                                          |
