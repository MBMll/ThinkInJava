| It is whidely believed that every word has a correct meaning, that we learn these meanings mainly from teachers and grammarians, and that dictionaries and grammars are the supreme authority in matters of meaning and usage. Few people ask by what authority the writers of dictioinaries and grammars say what they say. I once got into a dispute with an English woman over the pronunciation of a word and offered to look it up in the dictionary. The English woman said firmly, "What for? I am English. I was born and brought up in England. The way I speak is English." Such self-assurance about one's own language is fairly common among the English. In the United States, however, anyone who is willing to quarrel with the dictionary is regarded as either eccentric or mad.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Let us see how dictionaries are made and how the editors arrive at definitions. What follows applies only to those dictionary offices where first-hand, original research goes on -- not those in which editors simply copy existing dictonaries. The task of writing a dictionary begins with the reading of vast amounts of the literature of the period or subject that the dictionary is to cover. As the editors read, they copy on cards every interesting or rare word, every unusual or peculiar occurrence of a common word, a large number of common words in their ordinary uses, and also the sentences in which each of these words appears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| That is to say, the context of each word is collected, along with the word itself. For a really big job of dictionary writing, such as the Oxford English Dictionary, millions of such cards are collected, and the task of editing occupies decades. As the cards are collected, there will be for each word anywhere from two or three to several hundred quotations, each on its card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| To define a word, then, the dictionary editor places before him the stack of cards illustrating that word; each of the cards represents an actual use of the word by a writer of some literary or historical improtance. He reads the cards carefully, dicards some, re-reads the rest, and divides up the stack according to what he thinks are the several senses of the word. Finally, he wirtes his definition must be based on what the quotations in front of him reveal about the meaning of the word. The editor cannot be influenced by what he thinks a given word ought to mean. He must work according to the cards, or not at all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| The writing of a dictionary, therefore, is not a task of setting up authoritative statements about the "true meanings" of words, but a task of recording, to the best of one's ability, what various words have meant to authors in the distant or immediate past. If, for example, we had been writing a dictionary in 1890, or even as lare as 1919, we could have said that the word "broadcast" means "to scater" (seed, for example), but we could not have stated that from 1921 on, the most common meaning of the word should become "to send out programs by radio or television." In choosing our words when we speak or write, we can be guided by the historical record provided us by the dictionary, but we cannot be bound by it, because new situation, new experience, new inventions, new feelings, are always forcing us to give new uses to old words. Looking under a "hood." we should ordinarily have found, five hundred years ago, a monk; today, we find a car engine. |

| With the coming of the television age and the increasing emphasis on pictures and sound in all quarters of our society, many people would on pictures and sound in all quarters of our society, many people would have us believe that we are moving repidly away from reading as a necessary life skill. But this is not the case at all.                                                                                                 |
| Good reading is a more important life skill than ever before and printed word continues to be the cornerstont of both higher education and better positions in the job market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| For students, almost all studying involves reading. For adults, reading is day to day, either a stumbling block or a smooth path to pleasure and opportunity. This is why good reading habits are not only an important study skill for the student, but also an important life skill for anyone.                                                                                                                                          |
| SCANNING -- You can get g good idea about the material by taking a few monents right off to read the title, chapter heading, section titles and headlines. The purpose of scanning is to get a quick understanding of what to expect from the reading, so that you will know what you are reading as you go along.                                                                                                                         |
| Mpas, charts, graphs and pictures are clues that will help the reader to cue in on the content and organization of the material. This simple technique of scanning can help you read for ideas because you will know where you are going when you begin to read.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| READING SPEED -- Another good reading habit is reading fast. The expression "haste makes waste" does not apply to reading. In fact, most people read much too slowly. Right now you are probably reading this slower tahn you need for good comprehension. Studies show that fast readers are the best readers, and that slow readers often lose their concentration and comprehension abilities because their will wander out of boredom. |
| Remember, nothing hurts concentration more than reading too slowly. Your mind will keep up with your reading speed if you ask it to. By always reading at your top speed, you challege your understanding and make it easier for your mind to concentrate on the material.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| VOCABULARY BUILDING -- For a person with good reading habits, a printed page contains not only words but ideas, actions, thoughts and feelings. But all these things are built on words. The more words you are familiar with, the less you are aware of reading words and the more you are aware of content and meaning. Expanding your vocabulary with help you to read more effectivly and rapidly.                                     |
| Many people simply skip over words they do not understand. This, naturally, hurts their overall comprehension. Other people stop at each new word and look it up in the doctionary, but this mehod can show down you reading, affecting concentration and comprehension.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| But you can build your vocabulary without suing a dictionary each time. Here are two rules:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 1. Pause for a monent on each now word and let if register in your mind.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2. Try to guess what the word means from context clues, from the words around it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| What happens with this method is that you will see the word again and again. Each tie you will have a stronger impression of the meaning. Soon, the new word will be familiar and its meaning clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| The key to the method is to be alert to new words. Don't skip over them. You'll find you are adding to your vocabulary each day and a good strong vocabulary is a great help to reading quickly and with strong comprehension.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Good reading habits like these can help students and working adults alike to be more successfull. The special world of school and the real world of school and of everyday life can be more confortables productive and rewarding with the addition of simple yet important life skills such as good reading habits.                                                                                                                       |
