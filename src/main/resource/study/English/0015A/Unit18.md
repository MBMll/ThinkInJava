| _&bull; Why Are Maps Drawn with North at the Top?_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Now it is hard to visualize a map that does not feature north at the top, but this was not always so.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| The oldest known map in the accepted sense of the word was drawn about 3,800 BC and represent the river Euphrates flowing through northem Mesopotamia, Iraq. This, and others that followed it, were little more rough sketches of localized features; it was not many centuries later the ancient Greeks placed the science of map-making on a sound footing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| At the forefront of the pioneers in the field was the Greeks mathematician and philosopher Claudius Ptolemaeus (c. AD 90 ~ 168), more populary known to history as Ptolemy. The last great scientist of the classical period, he was the first to draw a map that was based on all available knowledge, rather than guess or imagination. Earlier, the Babylonians had attempted to map the world, but they presented it in the form of a flattened to map the world, but they presented it in the form of a flattened disc rather than a sphere, which was the from adopted by Ptolemy. |
| Given the state of knowledge of those times, he got things wrong; for example, his estimate of China and the Atlantic Ocean was for from being accurate. Nevertheless, it was a useful effort, and the map remained a work of reference for over a thousand years. In fact, Christopher Columbus used a version of it when he set sail in search of the New World -- which caused him some navigational problems, since Ptolemy had calculated wrongly the size of the Atlantic and was unaware that the Pacific Ocean existed.                                                          |
| The really improtant thing about Prolemy's map was thaat north was at the top. The reason for this was that he decided to orientate the map in the direction of the Pole star since Polaris was the immorable guiding light in which the voyagers of that are placed their trust.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| North at the top remained the accepted arrangement until the early Middle Ages, when the Church began to interface seriously with the advance of science. In accordance with the orders of the Church, maps were still produced in accordence with Ptolemy's principles -- but now Jerusalem was the central feature, as it was held to be the center of the Christian faith, and east was moved to the top.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| These maps are often called "T" Maps because they show only three continents -- Europe, Asia and Africa -- separated by the "T" formed by the Mediterranean Sea and the River Nile. From a navigational point of view, they were almost useless.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| More accurate maps began to appear in the 14th century, with the spread of trade and increasing reliance on the compass. Once again, north assumed its rightful place at the top of maps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Two train are traveling side by side and at the same speed along parallel tracks. We are seated in one of the trains, and with us we have a special speedometer that measures their relative speed. Since the trains are travelling at the some speed, their relative speed is zero; the speedometer therefore reads "O".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Suddenly the other train seems to start pulling ahead of ours. The speedometer shows a reading of 10 miles per hour. The other train has apparently increased its speed. But can we be absolutelyt certain of this increase?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| If your answer is yse, you are wrong. You are wrong because all that we know is that the relative speed between the two trains changed from 0mph to 10 mph. Nothing more. This change could have been brought about in one of two ways:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The other train increased its speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2. Our train decreased its speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| There are thus two possible explanations to account for the change in speed, but we don't know which one is right. Furthermore, regardless of which explanation we choose, the end result will be the same: the other train will arrive at the station first. So it makes no difference wether we say that the other train increased its speed or that our train decreased its speed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Since both explanations lead to the same result, you can choose either one. Whenever two things are relative, you can choose either one of them. The converse is also true: whenever you have a choice between two things that are equally possible, then the things are relative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| There is no reason, except convenience, for choosing one explanation over the other. The relative speed between the trains remains the same, 10 mph; and the end result will be the same.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Now let's suppose that both trains are at the railroad station loading and unloading passengers and baggage. A half-hour passes. As we look at the other train through our window, we see that our train seem to start moving, smoothly and slowly. For a minute or so, our train seems to travel at a uniform speed. Our slowly. For a minute or so, our train seems to travel at a uniform speed. Our special speedometer shows that the relative speed between the two train is 20 mph. But as we look out our window, we suddenly see the last coach of the other train disappear from sight and notice the motionless station behind it. So we are not moving after all. The other train has been moving! |
| This peculiar[特殊的] and often frustrating experience is an effect of relative motion. At the train station we cannot tell, whether it was our train that changed ist speed from 0 mph to 20 mph or whether it was the other train that changed its speed from 0 mph to 20 mph. Only after the other train pulled out of the station could we see that it, and not our train, was moving.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Now let us again raise the question that was raised at the beginning of this aricle: can we be absolutely certain that the other train did indeed increase it speed, and in this case pull out of the station?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| If you answer is yes, then you are wrong again. ALl we can be certain of is that the relation speed between the two trains changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| These examples illustrate[举例;说明] an important principle[原理, 原则; 主义, 道义; 本质, 本义; 根源, 源泉] in the special theory[理论; 原理; 学说; 推测] of relativity. If A appears to be moving at a steady speed relative to B, we cannot know for sure if it is A that is really moving. Perhaps A is standing still, and B is moving. Or perhaps both are moving. According to realtivity, there is no experiment that can be devised to solve the problem. As there is no way of deciding which of the who objects is moving, we can choose either one as the moving object. The reason is that their motion is relative, and relativity, as we have seen, means that we have a choice.                                             |
| This principle -- that if two objects are in uniform motion relative to each other, it is impossible to decide which one is moving and which one is at rest -- applies to all objects moving uniformly in a straight line through the universe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| In relativity you'll find that whenever you have a choice among things that are equally possible, you are dealing with relative things. For example, time, which is measured with clocks and watches, is relative because it can be shown that there is more than one system of time. All systems of time are equally possible and you can choose any system you wish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
